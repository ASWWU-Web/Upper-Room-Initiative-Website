# Upper-Room-Initiative-Website
A website that integrates "prayer pins" and social media. 
##To Do's
### The site should contain
* a section that uses Google's apis to create a map of all the "pins" from their respective latitude and longitude
* a section with some information about the project.(Waiting for Stephen).
* a section with facebook integration.
* :heavy_check_mark: a section with instagram integration.

### Links/Buttons
* Contact Stephen for information, to get involved, buy pins, etc
* :heavy_check_mark: ASWWU.com cause we're awesome. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* Open a popup which lets you enter information into a modal such as full name, email, and address (needs to query Google's api again to get the appropriate latitude and longitdue.)
