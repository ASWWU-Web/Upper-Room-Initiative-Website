# Upper-Room-Initiative-Website
A website that integrates "prayer pins" and social media. 
##To Do's
The site should contain
1. a section that uses Google's apis to create a map of all the "pins" from their respective latitude and longitude
2. a section with some information about the project, which Stephen is apparently writing today
3. a section with social media integration of some sorts (Facebook and Instagram)
###
1. Contact Stephen for information, to get involved, buy pins, etc
2. ASWWU.com cause we're awesome
3. Open a popup which lets you enter information into a modal such as full name, email, and address (needs to query Google's api again to get the appropriate latitude and longitdue
